Fixes:
1) README.txt is really vague. It only states what type of game it is and essentially does nothing else.
2)HighScores needs javadoc comments and is Junit tests, the code is messy.

Pros:
1) build.xml looks good, has descriptions when ant -p is used.

Good files: 
MemoryGameLevel.java
MemoryGrid.java
MemoryGameLevel.java
MemoryGameGui.java
HighScoreBoard.java
