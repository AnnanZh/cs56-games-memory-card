Yun Suk Chang worked on this in S13.  There were other authors before him.
Xiaohe he and Shaoyi Zhang worked on this in W16.

Several others have worked on it since then.

W16 Final Remarks:
We don't think this is a good project for students at any level of proficiency with Java.
The main reason is that this project is very well-built in terms of game logic and design.
For Java newbees, you won't be able to learn much about GUI, since the main structure is well-built.
For people who know Java from kindergartens, you might find this project boring.
We worried a lot about the "shrink" of points when we were working on this project.
Many issues we fixed are actually bugs instead of fundamental changes.
To fix a bug in a large project written by other undergraduate students is hard.
It might take hours to pinpoint a bug, but only write one line to fix the bug.

However, if you are brave and choose to work on this project:
We recomend you to start early and work on the issues created by Professor Conrad several years ago.
You will learn a lot from those issues. We didn't work on those good issues because we are distract by those "shrinking" issues.
