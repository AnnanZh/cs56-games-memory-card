cs56-memory-card-game
=====================

This is a memory card game in which the player tries to match pairs of cards
based on their pictures.

The faster the player can match the cards, the higher their score will be.
Each time they make an incorrect match, they lose points.

The first level begins with a small grid, and each level that follows gets
increasing more difficult (the grid goes larger and larger).

At any point during the game, the player can click the reset button if they
would like to start over again.

At the end of the game, if the user has reached a new high score, they get
to enter their name into the leaderboard.



Instructions
============

Launch the game on terminal with
```
ant run
```

After launching the game, you can choose one of three options:

### 1. Start the game
Allows the user to begin playing.

### 2. Instructions
Gives the user detailed instructions on how to play the game.

### 3. High Score
Lets the user view the current leaderboard, with the names and scores of the best players.

Yun Suk Chang worked on this in S13.  There were other authors before him.
Xiaohe he and Shaoyi Zhang worked on this in W16.

Several others have worked on it since then.

W16 Final Remarks:
We don't think this is a good project for students at any level of proficiency with Java.
The main reason is that this project is very well-built in terms of game logic and design.
For Java newbees, you won't be able to learn much about GUI, since the main structure is well-built.
For people who know Java from kindergartens, you might find this project boring.
We worried a lot about the "shrink" of points when we were working on this project.
Many issues we fixed are actually bugs instead of fundamental changes.
To fix a bug in a large project written by other undergraduate students is hard.
It might take hours to pinpoint a bug, but only write one line to fix the bug.

However, if you are brave and choose to work on this project:
We recomend you to start early and work on the issues created by Professor Conrad several years ago.
You will learn a lot from those issues. We didn't work on those good issues because we are distract by those "shrinking" issues.
