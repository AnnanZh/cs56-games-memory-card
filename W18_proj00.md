## Project description
This project is a game that requires the player to match pairs of identical pictures from a bunch of pictures. The game has three different levels, from beginner to advanced.

## Current features as described by user stories 
- User Story 1: As a game lover, I can identify two same pictures and match them together so that I can get points.
- User Story 2: As a proficient player, I can choose the different kinds of difficulties of the game so that I will not get bored playing the low level.
- User Story 3: As a player, I can check the highest score so that I can know my rank.

## Current state of the project
The software successfully runs. When running, the software first gives the user several options including
   - Checking the highest score
   - Choosing level of difficulties and starting the game
   - Consulting instructions

## Possible features as described by user stories
- User Story 1: As a player, I want to have more choices of picture so that I will not get bored with the game.
- User Story 2: As a player, I want to see more special effects so that the game will be more attractive to me.

## Possible improvement of README.md
I believe including a working log of the project would be helpful. I also think the existing features and potential features that may be implemented should also be included

## Evaluation of the build.xml
It's based on Ant. So far so good. The code is clean with sufficient descriptions.

## Evaluation of current issues
There are enough issues to work on. The descriptions of the issues are clear enough.

## Proposal of new issues
Cannot resume in one click after pausing the game https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-projects/cs56-games-memory-card/issues/71

## Evaluation of current codes
Overall the codes are organized very well. However, some comments can be removed as they are just some codes that are commented out. Some indentation can be improved.

## Evaluation of current test coverage
Right now, the test covers a lot of things but still not all the things. Also, the test for each case is not enough. We can add a few tests for each case in the future
