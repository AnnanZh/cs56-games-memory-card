Game 
Description
1. This project is a game that requires the player to match pairs of identical pictures from a bunch of pictures. The game has three different levels, from beginner to advanced.
2. - User Story 1: As a game lover, I can identify two same pictures and match them together so that I can get points.
   - User Story 2: As a proficient player, I can choose the different kinds of difficulties of the game so that I will not get bored playing the low level.
   - User Story 3: As a player, I can check the highest score so that I can know my rank.
3. The software successfully runs. When running, the software first gives the user several options including
   - Checking the highest score
   - Choosing level of difficulties and starting the game
   - Consulting instructions
4. - User Story 1: As a player, I want to have more choices of picture so that I will not get bored with the game.
   - User Story 2: As a player, I want to see more special effects so that the game will be more attractive to me.
5. I believe including a working log of the project would be helpful. I also think the existing features and potential features that may be implemented should also be included
6. It's based on Ant. So far so good. The code is clean with sufficient descriptions.
7. There are enough issues to work on. The descriptions of the issues are clear enough.
8. Cannot resume in one click after pausing the game https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-projects/cs56-games-memory-card/issues/71
9. Overall the code is organized very well. However, some comments can be removed as they are just some codes that are commented out. Some indentation can be improved.
10. Right now, the test covers a lot of things but still not all the things. Also, the test for each case is not enough. We can add a few tests for each case in the future
